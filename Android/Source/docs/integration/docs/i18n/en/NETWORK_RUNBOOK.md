# SUMUWW Android 0.6.95 · Node operation

SUMUWW Android 0.6.95 · The node validates, stores, relays and exposes chain data.

## Network and addresses

The public network is `sumuww`; `dora` is its internal alias. Check the genesis hash below. Native addresses use witness v0 P2WPKH and HASH160 of a compressed secp256k1 public key. There is no mandatory memo or tag. Reject wrong-network addresses and invalid checksums. Record each HD receive/change branch and index; do not assume Bitcoin's derivation path.

## Transaction and block lookup

`getrawtransaction` searches the active chain and mempool, not orphan-only transactions. Inputs identify outpoints, not a unique sender address. `getblock` takes Boolean `verbose`; inactive stored blocks have `active=false` and `confirmations=-1`. Their raw transactions remain available by block hash. `findspendingtransaction` searches confirmed active-chain spends only; null does not prove availability. Check `gettxout` with `include_mempool=true`. All confirmations and active flags can change after a reorganization.
