The node adds fee queries, submission checks, RBF replacement status and ordered block data records. Replacements are validated before any pending transaction is removed. Multisig and output locks are implemented for isolated activation tests; they are not yet active on the public network.

1 SMW = 100,000,000 yugeon. Automatic fees offer slow, normal and fast presets based on local observations; they do not guarantee confirmation times. You can enter a rate in yugeon/vB manually. Review the final fee and total in SMW before sending. A rejected transaction does not debit your balance.

`1 yugeon = 0.00000001 SMW`

`1 SMW = 100,000,000 yugeon`

Automatic fees use current pending volume, block capacity and transaction priority. Past block fees are not used. A quiet queue keeps the minimum rate. The preview refreshes; the final confirmation fixes the fee. Observations cover the connected local node, not every node.

Wallet history retains local replacement records after restart. Removed transactions do not affect the balance.

Explorer shows revealed multisig and output-lock conditions. Public activation remains unscheduled.


Mining history separates new issuance, transaction fees and total reward for each block. Your received amount is shown separately. A partial claim does not identify how the two components were divided. The node provides 28 RPC methods, including fee estimation, and validates and relays signed transactions.
