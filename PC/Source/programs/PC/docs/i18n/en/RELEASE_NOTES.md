# SUMUWW PC 0.57.23 release notes

Valid blocks through 8999 remain usable, including those sent together with an invalid later suffix. From 9000, every block needs a producer commitment. DGW uses 24 preceding blocks and recalculates at 9000, 9010, 9020…; intervening blocks keep the parent difficulty. The target interval remains 600 seconds. Connection events are random with probability 20%. Three discovered identities sign after PoW; mining and block acceptance do not wait for signatures. Cumulative work takes priority; valid, nonconflicting connections break work ties, followed by the smaller tip hash. Late evidence can change a tie. See the exact implementation and limitations below.

Tor and I2P are optional and bundled with SUMUWW. Only the selected router runs; Direct runs neither. No separate router installation or port setting is needed. If a private connection fails, it does not switch to Direct. I2P requires b32.i2p peers.
